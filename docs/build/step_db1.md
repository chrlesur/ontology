You are an expert Go developer tasked with enhancing the Ontology project by implementing a temporary database approach for ontology merging. After a thorough review of the existing codebase, particularly the pipeline package, follow these steps precisely while adhering to the given guidelines:

Guidelines:
1. Use only the latest stable version of Go.
2. Ensure no source code file exceeds 3000 tokens.
3. Limit each package to a maximum of 10 exported methods.
4. No method should exceed 80 lines of code.
5. Follow Go best practices and idiomatic patterns.
6. All user-visible messages must be in English.
7. Each exported function, method, and type must have GoDoc compliant documentation comments.

For each step, provide the complete Go code, including package declarations, imports, and documentation comments. Ensure the code is production-ready, efficient, and follows Go conventions.

Step 1: Database Setup
Create a new file 'db.go' in the pipeline package. Implement the following:
a. A function initDB() to initialize an in-memory SQLite database.
b. Define the schema for 'entities' (id, name, type, description) and 'relations' (id, source, type, target, description) tables.
c. Create appropriate indexes for performance optimization.
d. Ensure compatibility with the existing model.OntologyElement and model.Relation structs.

Step 2: Database Operations
In the same 'db.go' file, implement these functions:
a. insertEntity(db *sql.DB, entity *model.OntologyElement) error
b. insertRelation(db *sql.DB, relation *model.Relation) error
c. upsertEntity(db *sql.DB, entity *model.OntologyElement) error
d. upsertRelation(db *sql.DB, relation *model.Relation) error
e. getAllEntities(db *sql.DB) ([]*model.OntologyElement, error)
f. getAllRelations(db *sql.DB) ([]*model.Relation, error)
Ensure each function has proper error handling, uses the existing logger for logging, and has documentation.

Step 3: Merge Function
In 'segmentation.go', implement the mergeResultsWithDB function:
a. Function signature: func (p *Pipeline) mergeResultsWithDB(previousResult string, newResults []string) (string, error)
b. Initialize the database using initDB().
c. Parse previousResult and newResults, inserting them into the database.
d. Implement merge logic using upsert functions.
e. Retrieve and return the merged results as a string in the format compatible with the existing code.
f. Use p.logger for logging throughout the function.

Step 4: Pipeline Integration
Modify the processSinglePass function in 'segmentation.go':
a. Update the function to use mergeResultsWithDB instead of the current merging logic.
b. Ensure proper database connection handling and error management.
c. Maintain compatibility with existing ProgressCallback and other pipeline processes.

Step 5: Conflict Resolution
Implement simple conflict resolution logic in the upsert functions:
a. For entities: choose the longer description or combine descriptions if they differ.
b. For relations: merge descriptions if other fields are identical.
c. Use p.logger.Debug for logging resolved conflicts.

Step 6: Performance Optimization
a. Implement periodic database cleaning within mergeResultsWithDB.
b. Use prepared statements for repeated insertions to improve performance.
c. Adjust SQLite cache size for optimal memory performance.
d. Ensure these optimizations don't interfere with the existing pipeline flow.

Step 7: Testing
Create unit tests for all new functions in 'db_test.go' and integration tests for mergeResultsWithDB in 'segmentation_test.go'. Ensure tests cover:
a. Database initialization and operations.
b. Merging scenarios including conflict resolution.
c. Performance with large datasets.
d. Compatibility with existing Pipeline struct and its methods.

Step 8: Error Handling and Logging
Implement robust error handling for all database operations. Use the existing logger (p.logger) for logging, maintaining consistency with the current logging patterns in the pipeline package.

Step 9: Documentation
Update documentation in 'pipeline.go' and 'segmentation.go' to reflect the new merging approach. Add detailed comments for all new functions in 'db.go', following the existing documentation style in the project.

Proceed with implementing each step. After completing each step, wait for confirmation before moving to the next. If you need clarification on any part of the implementation or encounter conflicts with existing code, ask before proceeding.
