# Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides tips for optimizing the performance of Ontology, especially when dealing with large documents.

## Document Parsing

- For large PDF files, consider using the `pdfcpu` library instead of `unipdf` for faster parsing
- Implement streaming parsers for very large documents to reduce memory usage

## Segmentation

- Adjust the `max_tokens` configuration based on the LLM model being used
- For very large documents, consider parallel processing of segments

## LLM Integration

- Use batch processing when possible to reduce the number of API calls
- Implement caching mechanisms for LLM responses to avoid redundant calls

## Memory Management

- Use buffers and streaming techniques when processing large files
- Implement garbage collection hints in long-running operations

## Concurrency

- Utilize goroutines for parallel processing of documents and segments
- Use worker pools for managing concurrent LLM API calls

## Configuration Tuning

Adjust these configuration parameters for optimal performance:

- `max_tokens`: Increase for faster processing, decrease for more detailed analysis
- `context_size`: Balance between maintaining context and reducing token usage

## Monitoring and Profiling

- Use the built-in logging system to monitor performance metrics
- Employ Go's pprof tools for detailed performance profiling:
  ```
  go tool pprof [binary] [profile]
  ```

## Benchmarking

- Create benchmarks for critical operations using Go's benchmark functionality
- Regularly run benchmarks to catch performance regressions:
  ```
  go test -bench=. ./...
  ```

## Large-Scale Processing

For processing very large datasets:

- Implement a distributed processing system using tools like gRPC or message queues
- Consider using a database for storing intermediate results in long-running jobs

Remember to always test performance optimizations with realistic datasets to ensure they provide actual benefits in your specific use case.
